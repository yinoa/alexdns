mtr [-4|-6] [-F FILENAME] [--report] [--report-wide] [--xml] [--gtk] [--curses] [--displaymode MODE] [--raw] [--csv] [--json] [--split] [--no-dns] [--show-ips] [-o FIELDS] [-y IPINFO] [--aslookup] [-i INTERVAL] [-c COUNT] [-s PACKETSIZE] [-B BITPATTERN] [-G GRACEPERIOD] [-Q TOS] [--mpls] [-a ADDRESS] [-f FIRST-TTL] [-m MAX-TTL] [-U MAX-UNKNOWN] [--udp] [--tcp] [--sctp] [-P PORT] [-L LOCALPORT] [-Z TIMEOUT] [-M MARK]


Run the following MTR test from the source with --tcp to make sure that the MTR will be using TCP not Icmp:

mtr --tcp --port 22 --report --psize 1500 --report-cycles 10 20.41.78.238

Also try to use the port that the service use (port 22 is an example).


Now to better troublshoot this issue we will need you kindly  to run the following commands while the issue is happening:
 
1- Traces/pcaps From source and destination when the issue is happening
 
If you are using Linux please use the following commands:
 
sudo tcpdump -s0 -vvv -C 500 -w $HOSTNAME.`date +%F.%H.%M.%S.`TEST.pcap
 
If you are using Windows on the source side (as I know the destination on Azure is Linux) please use the following:
 
netsh trace start capture=yes scenario=netconnection maxSize=500 tracefile=%temp%\%computername%_nettrace.etl 
 
then to stop it after the issue got reproduced use:
 
netsh trace stop
 
2- Run the following MTR test from the source with --tcp to make sure that the MTR will be using TCP not Icmp:
 
mtr --tcp --port 22 --report --psize 1500 --report-cycles 10 20.41.78.238
 
Also try to use the port that the service use (port 22 is an example).
 
3- Run Nping as follows from the source:
 
nping  20.41.78.238 -p 22 -c 5000, where c is count <--- we need to use the same Port number used in MTR which is the port that the service is listening at.
